<h1>Description</h1>

  This project is a simple web application that stores tasks with their date and time. Every task has its own title, description,
  date and time. Application has features of adding, deleting, editing and displaying tasks. A thing that is worth mentioning is 
  that I created this project to memorize things I learned about technologies listed below. 
  
  I'm planning to add users to bind the tasks to them and some security with Spring Security.
